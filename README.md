### Who is Caio?

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

So, i'm Caio, and i'm a self-taught front-end developer actually working on my knowledge and willing to make a better world through code and entrepeneurship. I like to work with ReactJS and its ecosystem even though i know that this learning process through this knowledge area is just beginning. I started to code when i was 15 with Python, but then i first met Javascript in a certificate program in Computing at the Federal Institute of Bahia :brazil:.
